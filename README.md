Code generated by ChatGPT 4o freemium model as an experiment on how self-reliant AI is in regards to coding full projects

## My reflections
ChatGPT could mostly do the entire code but it required quite some handholding and specific prompts needed in order to get the functionality I wanted. Out of the box ChatGPT didn't make certain assumptions such as "what if the directory doesn't exist" which required re-prompting to fix these assumptions and errors. There were an issue with the library itself that ChatGPT wasn't able to solve, such as adding the option tag to ignore errors from the library. Instead ChatGPT attempted try catches which still resulted in the program to stop executing as most of the logic is happening inside of the library. For a full reflection I decided to also ask chatgpt to summarize our dialogue with some objective data points which can be seen in the header below

## ChatGPT Reflection

### **Independent vs. Directed Implementation Analysis:**

* **Total Prompts:** 13
* **Initial Structure:** 60% independent. Implemented basic download and metadata logic independently across 2 prompts. You directed the fixed directory structure and metadata setup.
* **Error Handling for Unavailable Videos:** 30% independent. Addressed across 3 prompts. You explicitly requested handling; I refined it iteratively.
* **Skipping Existing Files:** 40% independent. Implemented logic independently after 1 prompt.
* **Extraction Process Optimization:** 50% independent. Identified filtering logic independently after 2 prompts based on your feedback.
* **Indentation and Structural Fixes:** 30% independent. Required 3 prompts to correct, indicating dependency on your guidance.

### **Conclusion:**

Across 13 prompts, I was **\~40% independent**, mainly implementing basic structure and simple error handling independently, but relied significantly on your direction for specific logic additions, error handling, and structural corrections. Would you like further refinement?
